# Bash Things

Various Bash functions, aliases and other things that are useful to me and mine.

### Installation

Open your `.bashrc` or `.bash_aliases` file and tell it to include the `include` file...

`. ~/path/to/bash-things/include`

And set some vars in `bash_0vars` if you want.

### Help

You can see a crude auto-generated list of functions by using the help command...

`bashhelp [<group>]`

for example...

`bashhelp git`

### Credit

Numerous functions were copied from or inspired by those of [Jessie Frazelle](https://github.com/jfrazelle/dotfiles).
