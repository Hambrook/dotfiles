# Bash Things

Various Bash functions, aliases and other things that are useful to me and mine.

### Installation

Symlink or source the `dotfiles/home/.bashrc` file to your `.bashrc` file.

Optionally create and set some vars in `~/.variables` if you want.

### Help

You can see a crude auto-generated list of functions by using the help command...

`bashhelp [<group>]`

for example...

`bashhelp git`

### Credit

Numerous functions were copied from or inspired by those of [Jessie Frazelle](https://github.com/jessfraz/dotfiles).
